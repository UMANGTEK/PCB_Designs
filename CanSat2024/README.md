These are the PCB designs for CanSat 2024, a total of 5 revisions were made in design. 2nd Revision was given for printing, learning from which, improvements were made and finally 5th revision was given for final print.

Design 1- This was a drastic improvement from the computer I made for 2023. This was designed in such a way that we only needed to connect battries and main switch, battery charging and power distribution components like
buck convertors were integrated in the design itself. Unlike last year, where we had to remove battry for charging and buck convertors were placed externally, this had it all on board. The battery which we were using are 
2x NCR18650B cells connected in series.

Design 2- Overall idea remained the same as design - 1 some improvements were made in connectors which made it more user friendly, and a overvoltage protection for microcontroller as also added without which the controller
kept on getting burn due to voltage rising above 3.3V as the pins were 3.3v tolerant.

This time I took care of trace width as per the current requirement for various components on board the flight computer which can be seen on design files.
